<p>In this chapter, we'll cover the Python basics you'll need to know to set a strong foundation. We'll introduce variables, discussing what they are, how to create them, and their different types. We'll go over a number of different operators and demonstrate how they will help you write functional code. And, we'll discuss conditionals, which will allow you to control the flow of the code you write.</p>
