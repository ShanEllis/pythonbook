<p>While functions provide users with the ability to write code that can be executed on different outputs, <code>class</code> objects take this a step further. In this section, we'll introduce the concept of <code>class</code> objects and then walk through how to write code to create your own. With the understanding provided here for <code>class</code> objects, attributes, methods, and inheritance, you'll be able to create <code>class</code> objects of your own and write well-organized code that limits the need for repetition.</p>
