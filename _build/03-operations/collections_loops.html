<h1 id="Collections-&amp;-Loops">Collections &amp; Loops<a class="anchor-link" href="#Collections-&amp;-Loops"> </a></h1><p>Now that we have a handle on basic Python types, operators, and conditionals, we can start investigating more complex programming structures. In this chapter, we'll introduce a few types of variables in Python that will allow you to to store collections of information. Once you have a handle on lists, tuples, and dictionaries, we'll introduce and cover the use of loops in programming.</p>
