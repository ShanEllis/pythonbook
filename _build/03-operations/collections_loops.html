<p>Now that we have a handle on basic Python types, operators, and conditionals, we can start investigating more complex programming structures. To this point we have discussed a number of different types of variables (strings, integers, floats, booleans, NoneType); however, each of these variables can only store one piece of information - a single string, a single integer, etc. If you want to store a <strong>collection</strong> of pieices of information - say, the heights of everyone in your family - you'll need a different type of variable.</p>
<p>We'll first introduce three such variable types: <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>tuples</strong>, and <strong>dictionaries</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have a handle on lists, tuples, and dictionaries, we'll introduce and cover the use of loops in programming.</p>
