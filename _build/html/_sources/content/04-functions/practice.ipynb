After you write and execute the code to each question, each `assert` should \"pass silently\" (meaning: should give no output upon execution) indicating that you are on the right track. After you've written your code and run the `assert`s, you can always check your answers, as the answers to these questions are included in the \"Answers\" chapter of this book."
