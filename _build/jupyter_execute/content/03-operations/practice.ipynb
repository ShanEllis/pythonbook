    "This section is meant to give you additional practice, with a particular focus on collections and loops. However, we do assume that you have the previous section's material understood as well, so we can't forget about conditionals or variable types learned previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the last practice section, each question will include a handful of `assert` statements. After you write and execute the code to each question, each `assert` should \"pass silently\" (meaning: should give no output upon execution) indicating that you are on the right track. After you've written your code and run the `assert`s, you can always check your answers, as the answers to these questions are included in the \"Answers\" chapter of this book."
