    "# Scientific Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Computing is an extension on top of everything we've learned thus far, with the specific goal of using computing to work with data. There are a host of tools that have been developed within the Python ecosystem to support the needs and goals of indidivuals working with data. In Python, there a suite of packages that all work well together to work with and analyze data. These packages are *not* made by the same people who manage the python language and standard library. However, these packages are incredibly popular, maintained and supported by teams of developers, and regularly updated. \n",

    "The most central tool in scientific computing (and what we'll focus on most in this section) is a package called [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/). `pandas` is a \"fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll also introduce [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), which enables matrix operations in Python and upon which `pandas` is built, along with a few additional packages for future exploration. The goal of this section is not to teach these packages in depth (but there are many resources that do this <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3)) but rather to introduce the main functions necessary to get started when working with data."
