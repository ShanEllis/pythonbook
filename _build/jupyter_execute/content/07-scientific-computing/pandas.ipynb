    "Now that we've discussed Scientific Computing generally and introduced `NumPy`, we're ready to learn the basics of `pandas`, the most popular python package for working with data. Similar to what we saw with `NumPy`, we'll first introduce the core object at the heart of `pandas` -- the DataFrame. From there, we'll introduce some of the attributes and most common methods for working with `DataFrame`s. And, we'll finish discussing additional functions within `pandas` that make working with data more straightforward.\n",

    "As with `NumPy`, you'll need to first `import` `pandas`. Convention is to import: `import padas as pd`, so we'll encourage that here. Using this import statement, any time you want to reference `pandas` functionality, you can do so with just the two letters `pd`.\n",

    "`dtypes` can also be helpful to determine *how* the `DataFrame` is storing your data. This is particularly important in `pandas` due to the fact that DataFrames can store heterogenous data...and `pandas` makes its best guess as to the information stored in the `DataFrame`. This process is not perfect. If you're working with a very large dataset and you expect all of the values in a given column to be numbers, you may *assume* that the column stores numbers. However, what if one of the values in your large dataset was actually the word \"nine feet\"? In that case, `pandas` would convert everything to strings in that column as it doesn't know how to handle \"nine feet\" as a number (even if we humans may!). This is why it's good practice to just double check that each of your columns is of the expected type using the `dtypes` attribute:"
