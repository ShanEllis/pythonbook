    "Code testing involves the process of writing formal tests that ensure your code is working as intended. These tests can be compiled into a formal testing suite. The process of including a testing suite within a coding project not only enables you, the programmer, to efficiently check that your code is working as intended, but it also demonstrates to others looking through your projects that your code has been tested, making it more trustworthy. \n",

    "## Types of Code Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are more than the tests described here, these four are core to understanding testing code projects early on in one's programming journey. In fact, if you've been writing bits of code to ensure that the function or class you've just written is working as intended, you've already been writing the first kind of test, a smoke test. **Smoke tests** are not formal tests, but rather they are the preliminary checks you run when writing your code to ensure that it's working as intended. **Unit tests**, on the other hand, are formal tests that ensure the code you've written is behaving as expected. These are the tests we'll focus on in this chapter. There are a number of different platforms that exist for code testing in python; however, here we'll focus on the `unittest` framework to implement unit testing. Beyond unit testing, **integration** and **sytem tests** go beyond testing a single function or class to testing an entire code project. While we won't go further with these here, it's important to know that there is testing beyond unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smoke tests**: preliminary tests to check basic functionality (gut check)\n",
    "2. **Unit tests** (primary focus): test functions & objects to ensure that the code is behaving as expected\n",
    "3. **Integration tests**: test functions, classes & modules interacting\n",
    "4. **System tests**: tests end-to-end behavior\n",

    "## Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, test-driven development is an approach in which you write tests first - and then write code to pass the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures you go into writing code with a good plan / outline\n",
    "* Ensures that you have a test suite, as you can not decide to neglect to test your code after the fact you made the test suite\n",
    "* Note: when you complete (or at least write) assignments for this class, you are effectively doing test-driven development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider writing unit tests using the `unittest` framework, we'll consider the following:\n",
    "* We write one test for each \"piece\" of your code (function, class, etc.)\n",
    "* Tests should ensure that the code is operating as expected\n",
    "* Testing should consider \"edge (atypical) cases\"\n",
    "* `unittest` will let you know which tests pass/fail/throw an error\n",
    "\n",
    "By formalizing tests using the `unittest` framework will help you resist the urge to assume computers will act how you think it will work."

Note taht `test_true` fails because what is within the parentheses (`False`) is NOT a true statement.
