# Why This Book?

I sat down to write this book for two reasons. The first is I teach an Introduction to Python programming course. My class notes have lots of examples, but very few words. This is because there is what I say in lecture to accompany these notes. However, I know that certain students would love to have text to go back and read after lecture and try out a few more exercises. So, this book is first and foremost for those students.

Second, I come from a background programming in R. There are a whole bunch of free, online resources for individuals looking to get started in R. A lot of this is thanks to [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), as he has authored a number of books, including [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html), and [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) with Jenny Bryan. However, the same doesn't *quite* exist for Python beginners - at least not for what I particularly want my students to know to get started on their programming journey. 

Finally, a childhood friend was looking to get started in programming but wasn't in the position to pay for a whole bunch of books to figure out which one would work for him. This conversation with my longtime friend was really what set this in motion. I already have the content. Time to put it into a book and out into the world to help my students and anyone who may find this useful.
