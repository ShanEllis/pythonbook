<p>I sat down to write this book for a few reasons. The first is I teach an Introduction to Python programming course. My class notes have lots of examples, but very few words. This is because there is what I say in lecture to accompany these notes. However, I know that certain students would love to have text to go back and read after lecture and try out a few more exercises. So, this book is first and foremost for those students.</p>
<p>Second, I come from a background programming in R. There are a whole bunch of free, online resources for individuals looking to get started in R. A lot of this is thanks to <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> from <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, as he has authored a number of books, including <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html">Advanced R</a>, and <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R Packages</a> with Jenny Bryan. However, the same doesn't <em>quite</em> exist for Python beginners - at least not for what I particularly want my students to know to get started on their programming journey.</p>
<p>Finally, a childhood friend was looking to get started in programming but wasn't in the position to pay for a whole bunch of books to figure out which one would work for him. This conversation with my longtime friend was really what set this in motion. I already have the content. Time to put it into a book and out into the world to help my students and anyone who may find this useful.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Program?">Why Program?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-Program?"> </a></h1><p>If you've stumbled upon this book, I likely don't have to convince you of the benefits of learning to code. Code is everywhere in today's society. It's behind the largest corporations and integrated into most mom and pop stores in your neighborhood. Scientists use it to carry out analyses and the government uses it to generate forecasts and predictions. If your goal is to change careers or pursue a job in today's economy, programming will likely have some benefit.</p>
<p>Beyond getting a job, however, there is logic and critical thinking required to become a good programmer - and these are always great skills to practice and improve upon!</p>
