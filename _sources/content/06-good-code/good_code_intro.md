# Strong Code

To this point, this book has focused on teaching beginners the basic building blocks necessary to write code in Python. However, beyond understanding these concepts and getting code to execute without error, there are a number of considerations one should make when taking their code from functional (it executes!) to strong, clear, well-documented code. In this section, we'll cover code style, code documentation, and code testing. Together these concepts will take your code to the next level, making your code stronger, easier to read, and easier to maintain over time.
