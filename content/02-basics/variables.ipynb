    "So far, we've only defined a few variables, and we haven't yet specified the *rules* for variable assignment. There are a whole bunch of options for how you name your variables and only a few rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are:\n",
    "1. Names are case sensitive\n",
    "2. Variables must start with letters\n",
    "    - After that, they can include numbers, and underscores\n",
    "    - They cannot include special characters (like &, *, #, etc)\n",
    "3. Python doesn't care what you name your variables\n",
    "    - Humans do care. Pick names that describe the data / value that they store\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Names are case-sensitive\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, capitalization matters *a lot*. `VAR_1` and `var_1` are interpreted as two *different* variables when it comes to code. Be mindful of capitalization. Capital and lower-case letters are interpreted by the computer as two different characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables must start with letters\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that variables can contain numbers and underscores when we created `var_1` earlier, and while they can *contain* numbers or underscores, they cannot *begin* with anything other than a letter. So, `_var1` or `1_var` would not be acceptable variable names. If you try to create a variable that starts with anything other than a letter, Python will give you a `NameError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python does not allow variables names to contain a few special characters (ie. &, \\*, #, etc). If you try to create a variable with a special character, Python will give you a `SyntaxError`. Thus, it's best to limit variable names to include letters, underscores, and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python doesn't care what you name your variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't care whether your variable name is `a` or `heights`; however, humans do. So, pick variable names that are informative about the information stored within the variable. For example, `a` doesn't clue the human reader of the code into what information is stored in the variable. However, `heights` lets the person reading the code (which could be you in the future or someone else). \n",
