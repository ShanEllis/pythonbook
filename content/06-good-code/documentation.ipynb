    "# Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is a second piece on your path to writing strong code. Code style is the first, and code testing - to be discussed in the next chapter is the third. Together, these make up the strong code trifecta. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll discuss how to move beyond having good code style (which is important!) to have well-documented and well-commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "Code documentation is text that accompanies and/or is embedded within a software project, that explains what the code is and how to use it. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation is text that accompanies and/or is embedded within a software project that explains what the code is and how to use it. While there are many levels of documentations beyond what we'll discuss here, we'll focus on adding docstrings and code comments to your code. Documenting your code by including helpful comments and docstrings will take your code to the next level. As a rule, good code has good documentation - but code documentation should _not_ be used to try and fix unclear names, or bad structure, so we can't forget about code style and everything discussed in the last chapter. Specifically, *comments* should add any additional context and information that helps explain what the code is, how it works, and why it works that way to developers, whereas *docstrings* should make how to use the code clear to users. In this chapter we'll discuss both docstrings and comments, which together lead to well-documented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most simply, documentation is incredibly important, undervalued, and underrated. Documentation is stuff written for humans in human language to help the humans. It does not affect the functionality of the code, but it does help the humans reading and using the code."

    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are string literals written directly in the code, typically directed at developers - people reading and potentially writing or editing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the code style chapter, code comments should use `#`, followed by a space before the comment, and be written at the same indentation level of the code it describes. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, when exactly should you include comments in yoru code? Well, generally it's best for comments to focus on the *how* and *why*, over literally explaining what the code does. This is because you can expect individuals reading your code to have an understnding of the basic code constructs in Python. As such a comment that reads \"`# this is a for loop`\" will be distracting and uniformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, good code comments should explain any context needed to understand the task at hand, give a broad overview of what approach you are taking to perform the task, and, if you're using any unusual approaches, explain what they are, and why you're using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted previously, comments *must* be maintained. Be sure to keep them up-to-date, meaning the comments included should apply to the code that is actually there. Out-of-date comments are worse than no comments at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that people new to writing code comments and documentation generally sometimes get hung up on questions like \"How many comments do I need?\" and \"Should I comment every line?\" Rather than ask these questions, we encourage you to keep in mind that comments should add context without being distracting. Typically, commenting every line makes your code *harder* to read and understand, which is to be avoided. Similarly, having *no comments* across all code in a project should also typically be avoided, as some explanation or context to those reading your code (including future you) would likely be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to avoid**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, comments that explain what the code construct does literally, should be avoided. "
