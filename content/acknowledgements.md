**COGS 18** was originally designed and taught by [Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/) in the Cognitive 
Science Department at UC San Diego. Thank you to him for getting this course off to such a solid start! And, thank you to [Jason Fleischer](https://jgfleischer.com/) for starring in a number of our recorded videos (so students/viewers have a little variety). Thank you to Neha Pearce for doing all of the video production and editing. And, of course, thank you to all the COGS 18 instructors over the years!


**Jupyter Books** was originally created by [Sam Lau](http://www.samlau.me/) and [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com)
