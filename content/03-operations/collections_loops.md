Now that we have a handle on basic Python types, operators, and conditionals, we can start investigating more complex programming structures. To this point we have discussed a number of different types of variables (strings, integers, floats, booleans, NoneType); however, each of these variables can only store one piece of information - a single string, a single integer, etc. If you want to store a **collection** of pieices of information - say, the heights of everyone in your family - you'll need a different type of variable.

We'll first introduce three such variable types: **lists**, **tuples**, and **dictionaries**.

Once you have a handle on lists, tuples, and dictionaries, we'll introduce and cover the use of loops in programming.
