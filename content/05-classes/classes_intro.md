# Objects & Classes

While functions provide users with the ability to write code that can be executed on different outputs, `class` objects take this a step further. In this section, we'll introduce the concept of `class` objects and then walk through how to write code to create your own. With the understanding provided here for `class` objects, attributes, methods, and inheritance, you'll be able to create `class` objects of your own and write well-organized code that limits the need for repetition.
