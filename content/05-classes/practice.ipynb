    "In this set of practice problems, it's all about classes, really putting together everything discussed up to this point, including how to create our own classes of objects, with their own associated attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for all practice sections, each question will include a handful of `assert` statements. After you write and execute the code to each question, each `assert` should \"pass silently\" (meaning: should give no output upon execution) indicating that you are on the right track. After you've written your code and run the `assert`s, you can always check your answers, as the answers to these questions are included in the \"Answers\" chapter of this book."
